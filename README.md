## Overview
This repository contains container networking services and plugins for Linux and Windows containers running on Azure:

* [Azure CNI network and IPAM plugins](docs/cni.md) for Kubernetes.
* [Azure CNM (libnetwork) network and IPAM plugins](docs/cnm.md) for Docker Engine. **(MAINTENANCE MODE)**
* [Azure NPM - Kubernetes Network Policy Manager](docs/npm.md) (Linux and (preview) Windows Server 2022)

The `azure-vnet` network plugins connect containers to your [Azure VNET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview), to take advantage of Azure SDN capabilities. The `azure-vnet-ipam` IPAM plugins provide address management functionality for container IP addresses allocated from Azure VNET address space.

The following environments are supported:
* [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com): Available in all Azure regions.

Plugins are offered as part of [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/), as well as for individual Azure IaaS VMs. For Kubernetes clusters created by [aks-engine](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine), the deployment and configuration of both plugins on both Linux and Windows nodes is automatic and default.

The next generation of Azure CNI Plugin is powered by [Cilium](https://cilium.io/). Learn more at [Azure CNI Powered By Cilium](docs/cilium.md)
